# Employee Contract
Pay-R software is a contract-driven system, any employee registered in the system must have a valid contract 
in order to be considered as a valid employee. [A contract is issued](/employees/#issuing-employee-contract) after [employee creation](/employees/#adding-individual-employee).

## Issuing Contract to Employee
Please refer to [Issuing Contract](/employees/#issuing-employee-contract) section of this documentation

## Updating Contract of Employee
To update the contract of an employee, you need to access the employee in the [All Employees](/employees/#accessing-all-employees) Page, then select the employee whose contract
you would like to update. In the Personal Info Tab, click the pencil icon close to Contract Details header.

## Contract Tracking
Pay-R will keep track of all your employees' contracts and send you notifications when contracts are due to expire. You will get reminders
in 45 days, 30 days and 7 days to expiry.

## Contract Termination
If you would like to terminate the contract of your employee, you can easily do that by accessing the [All Employees](/employees/#accessing-all-employees) Page. Click on the employee
you would like terminate. In the [Employee Details Section](/employees/#viewing-employee-detail) click the red button labelled "Terminate Contract", then specify the reason for 
termination and click "ok" to execute termination.

Once the employee's contract is terminated, they will have a terminated status and will no longer be included in [Payroll](/payroll/).

## Accessing Terminated Employees
To access employees whose contracts have been terminated, expand the Employees menu in the sidebar and click on 
"Terminated Employees". All employees that have been terminated will be listed. Click on any of them to display extra details in the Employee
Details Section. This page looks similar to [All Employees Page](/employees/#accessing-all-employees)
 

## Contract Termination Notice
Pay-R allows you to easily issue a notice to employees before terminating the contract. Pay-R will then automatically terminate the contract
once the notice period ends. You can access this functionality in the [All Employees](/employees/#accessing-all-employees) Page. Select the employee you would like
to issue a notice and once their information loads in the [Employees Details Section](/employees/#employee-details-sections). Find and click a gray button labelled "Termination Notice".
