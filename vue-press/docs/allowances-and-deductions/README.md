# Allowances and Deductions
Pay-R supports issuing allowances and deduction to employees salaries. You can easily specify the allowances that apply to 
a certain employee in the respective contract.

## Allowances
If you provide monthly allowances to your employees you can specify in the contract of that employee check on 
[updating contract](/employee-contract/#updating-contract-of-employee) of employee and find the field of allowances and 
select the allowances you would like to issue. Once assigned, the allowances will be repeating
every time you run your payroll.
::: tip
The allowances specified in the contract are normally permanent unless disabled
:::

## Temporary Allowances
Sometime you may wish to provide allowance for just a specific period of time and not on a permanent basis, you only need 
to specify the number of installments and Pay-R will take care of the rest. To assign temporary allowances go to 
[All Employees](/employees/#accessing-all-employees) page and click on the employee you would like to assign allowance.
In the [Employee Detail](/employees/#viewing-employee-detail) Section at the Personal Info Section, click the Allowances 
button as shown in the screenshot below

and a form to add allowance will appear in the right as highlited in the screenshot below

To add your allowance select the allowance type, then specify the number of installments, write the payout amount
, effective and month and year and click the button to create new earning.

::: tip
By writting the number of installments as 0 will make the allowance repeating (permanent)
:::

Temporary allowances will be automatically disabled when all installments have been issued.

## Enabling/Disabling Allowances
Each of the assigned allowances will have a switch for activating or deactivating, toggle the switch to activate or 
deactivate.
